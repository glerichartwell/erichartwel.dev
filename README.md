Welcome to the github repo for my personal website!

I wanted to take the time to design and implement my personal website from scratch in a UI framework that was new to me. I developed this site using Vue. I have some work experience building web clients using Vue, but this was my first opportunity to build all of the components I would be using from scratch instead of using a library.

Many of the components I created for this site are built with reusability in mind. After the time I have spent on this project, I can easily say that Vue has become my favorite UI framework to build web clients with. In my opinion, the built in functionality and organization that Vue has is just unrivaled.

I left the setup instructions provided by Vite and Vue to make running this project on your local machine easier.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
